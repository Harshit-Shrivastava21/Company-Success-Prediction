# Company-Success-Prediction
More than 100 million startups are founded every year which equates 3 startups every second. According to the Forbes report 2018, around 90% of the startups fail within five years of founding while the rest are Merged and Acquired (M&amp;A) or go public (IPO). One of the reasons many fail is due to poor judgment by investors that lead to untimely and ill-rewarding investments. Therefore, in this project, given some key features of a startup, we want to predict the probability of its success. The objective of this project is to make a proficient and practical machine learning model to help VC firms make sound investments and gain heavy returns. This model can also guide startup founders by giving them insights on success probability of their startups based on certain categorical and quantitative parameters.
